## The Kling 2.5 Shot List

| Clip # | Character Asset | Motion + Context Prompt | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | `bulbasaur_walking_core.png` | Bulbasaur takes slow deliberate steps forward through wet undergrowth in misty wetland clearing. Front right leg and back left leg move forward in stable walking gait. Bulb sways gently on back with each step. Feet press into dark wet soil leaving tracks. Morning mist swirls around legs at ground level. Water droplets on grass blades catch golden sunlight. Slow push in. | Establishing shot - character enters scene |
| **02** | `bulbasaur_bulb_macro.png` | Single water droplet slides down waxy green bulb petal surface. Droplet moves slowly from top edge downward following petal curve. Morning light penetrates translucent petal edges showing faint purple-pink undertones. Tiny trichomes along petal seams are visible. Golden sunrise light creates warm highlights on waxy surface. Slow zoom in. | Extreme macro - establishes bulb texture |
| **03** | `bulbasaur_walking_core.png` | Bulbasaur crosses open clearing moving toward sunny patch ahead. Body moves steadily forward leaving visible trail through wet grass behind. Legs move in walking rhythm. Bulb sways with movement. Morning shadows of circling birds pass across ground and Bulbasaur's body. Golden sunlight illuminates clearing ahead. Volumetric mist drifts past. Slow tilt down. | Aerial perspective - shows vulnerability |
| **04** | `spearow_dive_core.png` | Spearow descends in diving attack position through morning air. Wings are partially tucked against body angled 45 degrees downward. Talons extend forward spread wide for striking. Beak points downward toward target below. Wing tip feathers flutter from speed. Black eyes focus forward with hunting intensity. Slow zoom in. | Predator attack approach |
| **05** | `spearow_talon_strike.png` | Spearow talons press into waxy green bulb petal surface. Three curved talons penetrate approximately 2-3mm creating small puncture indentations. Petal surface compresses around impact points. Lighter green tissue becomes visible beneath torn petal edges. Tiny trichomes along petal edges begin releasing microscopic powder particles visible as faint shimmer. Golden morning light catches talon edges. Slow zoom in. | ACTION SHOT - breaks micro-movement rule - shows actual strike impact |
| **06** | `bulbasaur_hunched_defensive.png` | Bulbasaur hunches low to ground in defensive crouch position. Eyes track upward following aerial movement above. Pupils dilate showing alertness. Body remains motionless in coiled stance. Limbs bear weight evenly distributed. Shadow of circling bird passes repeatedly across Bulbasaur's body and wet grass around clearing. Morning mist drifts across scene. Ferns visible in background 15 feet away. Slow orbit. | Defensive position - isolated in clearing |
| **07** | `bulbasaur_eye_closeup.png` | Bulbasaur eye tracks upward slowly following movement above. Vertical black slit pupil dilates slightly. Red sclera shows moisture sheen. Nictitating membrane moves partially across eye surface from corner. Tiny blood vessels visible in eye tissue. Barely visible bird silhouette reflects in eye's surface moisture showing corneal reflection. Surrounding bluish-green skin shows pores and texture. Slow drift right. | Extreme close-up - cold calculation moment |
| **08** | `bulbasaur_motionless_stance.png` | Bulbasaur stands perfectly still in center of clearing all four legs planted firmly. Body shows no movement demonstrating controlled stillness. Bulb remains closed on back. Blurred brown bird shape descends rapidly from top of frame growing larger. Bird wings begin spreading to brake. Golden morning backlight creates rim light around Bulbasaur silhouette. Volumetric mist swirls around scene. Slow pull back. | Commitment moment - prey accepts approach |
| **09** | `spearow_talon_strike.png` | Talons pierce bulb surface triggering petal flare. Bulb petals snap open rapidly exposing inner trichomes. Purple-green poison powder particles explode outward from exposed structures in expanding cloud. Particles catch golden backlight creating shimmer and glow effects. Powder blooms outward in spherical pattern from penetration point. Individual particles visible at cloud edges. Dust spreads through air catching light. Slow zoom in. | MONEY SHOT - ACTION SHOT - breaks micro-movement rule - poison explosion climax |
| **10** | `spearow_paralyzed.png` | Spearow hangs rigid in mid-air approximately 2 feet above ground frozen in unnatural suspended position. Wings locked extended at awkward asymmetrical angles. Beak gapes open wide showing pink mouth interior. Eyes stare wide with dilated pupils. Feathers stand ruffled and disorganized. Purple-green poison powder particles cling heavily to face and chest feathers. Body shows complete paralysis with no motion. Purple-green powder cloud still hangs in air behind bird backlit and shimmering. Slow zoom out. | Paralysis moment - suspended in air |
| **11** | `bulbasaur_photosynthesizing.png` | Bulbasaur stands in sunny clearing patch photosynthesizing. Body relaxed with limbs bearing weight evenly. Bulb petals closed showing faint golden-green glow at edges where sunlight penetrates translucent tissue. Very subtle purple powder residue dusts skin and nearby grass. Brown bird lies collapsed on wet grass 6 feet away in background out of focus with chest heaving rapidly. Orange-brown crab creature with red mushroom caps visible at clearing edge in far background very blurred. Morning mist clears. Sunlight illuminates entire clearing. Slow pull back. | Resolution - victor photosynthesizing, defeated predator breathing |

## Production Notes

### Two-Character Scene Analysis

**Scenes requiring multiple subjects in frame:**

- **Clip 06:** Bulbasaur + Spearow shadow - Single asset shows Bulbasaur, Spearow presence indicated by moving shadow
- **Clip 08:** Bulbasaur + descending Spearow - Asset `bulbasaur_motionless_stance.png` includes blurred Spearow in background descending
- **Clip 10:** Spearow + background Bulbasaur - Asset `spearow_paralyzed.png` includes Bulbasaur behind bird out of focus
- **Clip 11:** Bulbasaur + Spearow + Paras - Asset `bulbasaur_photosynthesizing.png` is composite showing all three (Spearow and Paras out of focus in background)

**All multi-character assets have been designed as integrated composites. No split-screen editing required.**

### Action Shots (Breaking Micro-Movement Rule)

The following clips show actual action sequences, not just breathing photographs:

- **Clip 05:** Talon strike impact - shows penetration and petal tearing
- **Clip 09:** Poison explosion - shows petals flaring and powder erupting

These shots may require multiple generation attempts in Kling 2.5.

### Environmental Continuity

**Consistent atmosphere across all clips:**
- Time: Early morning (6:00-7:00 AM) golden hour
- Weather: Post-rain, 85% humidity, mist clearing
- Lighting: Volumetric morning light, warm gold/orange directional, cool blue-green shadows
- Location: Temperate rainforest wetland margin, 40-foot clearing with fern undergrowth

### Camera Movement Summary

| Clip | Movement | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 01 | Slow push in | Entering scene, building anticipation |
| 02 | Slow zoom in | Revealing macro detail |
| 03 | Slow tilt down | Descending aerial perspective |
| 04 | Slow zoom in | Focusing on predator approach |
| 05 | Slow zoom in | Intensifying impact moment |
| 06 | Slow orbit | Showcasing defensive isolation |
| 07 | Slow drift right | Atmospheric eye tracking |
| 08 | Slow pull back | Revealing scale of confrontation |
| 09 | Slow zoom in | Maximum tension on climax |
| 10 | Slow zoom out | Showing aftermath consequences |
| 11 | Slow pull back | Concluding scene, revealing resolution |

### Prompt Construction Verification

**All prompts follow priority hierarchy:**
1. ✓ Core action first (what is happening)
2. ✓ Specific details (which body parts moving)
3. ✓ Logical sequence (step-by-step)
4. ✓ Environmental context (atmosphere, lighting)
5. ✓ Camera movement LAST (aesthetic enhancement)

**Plain language verified:**
- ✓ Simple clear sentences
- ✓ Specific body part references
- ✓ Logical sequential steps
- ✓ No flowery or poetic language
- ✓ No ambiguous actions

**Technical compliance:**
- ✓ Every clip ends with exactly ONE camera movement
- ✓ Motion sustainable for 10 seconds
- ✓ Faithful to source script (no added details)
- ✓ Describes motion + environmental context + camera (in that order)
- ✓ All prompts reference specific assets from manifest
