# Sound Effects Prompts - The Spearow Gambit

**Pokemon:** Bulbasaur
**Episode:** The Spearow Gambit
**Total Clips:** 11
**Duration per Clip:** 10 seconds

---

## Sound Design Overview

**General Environment:** Post-rain temperate rainforest wetland margin with morning mist clearing, wet vegetation, and humid atmosphere

**Key Sound Elements:**
- Continuous: Gentle wind through wet ferns, water dripping from leaves, morning bird calls (distant), soft rustling vegetation
- Recurring: Wet footsteps on grass, wing beats, water droplets falling into puddles
- Atmospheric: Morning humidity, mist drifting, sunlight warmth

**Character Sounds:**
- **Bulbasaur:** Slow deliberate footsteps in wet grass, soft vegetation brushing against body, quiet breathing
- **Spearow:** Sharp wing beats, diving air rush, aggressive screeching, talon impacts

**Mood Progression:**
- Clips 1-3: Calm, cautious (establishing vulnerability)
- Clips 4-6: Rising tension (predator approach, confrontation)
- Clips 7-8: Calculated suspense (decision moment)
- Clip 9: Explosive climax (poison powder release)
- Clips 10-11: Resolution (paralysis and victory)

## Sound Effects Prompt Table

| Clip # | Scene Summary | Sound Effect Prompt | Duration |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **01** | Bulbasaur emerging from ferns into clearing | Continuous wetland morning ambience with gentle wind rustling through wet fern fronds, steady water dripping from vegetation onto soil, distant morning bird calls echoing across clearing, soft footsteps squelching through saturated grass and mud puddles, with quiet breathing and vegetation brushing sounds, misty humid atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **02** | Extreme macro of bulb with water droplet | Continuous close-up plant surface ambience with soft morning breeze causing gentle leaf trembling, single water droplet slowly sliding down waxy petal surface, faint distant wetland sounds of dripping water and rustling vegetation, with microscopic texture sounds and dewdrop movement, intimate botanical atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **03** | Aerial view of Bulbasaur crossing clearing | Continuous overhead wetland clearing ambience with wind sweeping across wet grass creating soft rustling waves, water dripping from surrounding fern canopy, distant bird wings cutting through morning air, with steady footsteps leaving trail through saturated vegetation and circling predator shadow sounds, vulnerable exposed atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **04** | Spearow diving attack approach | Continuous morning sky ambience with wind rushing past descending bird, distant wetland sounds of dripping water and vegetation rustling below, air displacement from tucked wings accelerating downward, with aggressive wing beat adjustments and focused diving sound, predatory intensity building, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **05** | Talon strike impact on bulb | Continuous close-up impact ambience with wind rushing from diving approach, water droplets scattering and splashing into air, sharp talon scraping across waxy plant surface, with petal tearing sounds and suspended water droplets falling, frozen moment atmosphere with distant wetland background, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **06** | Bulbasaur hunched defensively, Spearow circling | Continuous tense clearing ambience with wind gusting across open wet grass, steady dripping from surrounding ferns, repeated bird shadow passing overhead with periodic wing beats, with Bulbasaur's controlled breathing and vegetation moving in breeze, isolated vulnerable atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **07** | Extreme close-up of Bulbasaur's eye | Continuous intimate biological ambience with quiet breathing rhythm, faint wind rustling distant vegetation, subtle moisture sounds on eye surface, with pupil dilation micro-movements and nictitating membrane sliding, distant circling predator wing beats overhead, calculating cold atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **08** | Bulbasaur motionless, Spearow descending | Continuous suspenseful clearing ambience with gentle wind through wet grass, steady water dripping echoing across wetland, mist wisps drifting past, with descending bird wing beats growing louder and air displacement increasing, complete stillness from prey below, commitment moment atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **09** | Poison powder explosion climax | Continuous explosive release ambience with bulb petals rapidly flaring open with organic snapping sounds, massive cloud of fine powder particles erupting and dispersing through air creating shimmer effect, with talon penetration impact and particle scatter sounds, golden backlit powder drifting, climactic toxic bloom atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **10** | Spearow paralyzed mid-air | Continuous paralysis onset ambience with poison powder cloud still hanging and drifting in air with particle suspension sounds, Spearow's rigid body locked with feathers ruffled unnaturally, labored breathing and wing extension freeze, with background wetland sounds of dripping water and wind, shocked frozen atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **11** | Resolution - defeated Spearow, photosynthesizing Bulbasaur | Continuous peaceful wetland ambience with morning mist clearing and sunlight warmth spreading, gentle wind through wet grass and ferns, water dripping steadily from vegetation, with collapsed bird's rapid chest heaving breathing and faint purple powder residue settling, victorious resolution atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |

## Notes

- Each 10-second sound effect is specific to its corresponding scene
- Sound effects work as background layer (mixed below narrator voice at ~25% volume)
- Designed to enhance immersion and match on-screen action
- All sounds are realistic nature documentary style, no music or fantasy elements
- Environmental continuity maintained: post-rain wetland atmosphere with morning clearing across all clips
- Continuous ambient bed (wind, dripping, vegetation) present in every clip
- Action sounds layered on top of ambient foundation for dynamic scene-specific atmosphere
