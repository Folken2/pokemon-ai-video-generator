## Production Notes for Kling AI Generation:

### Workflow Process:
1. **Image Upload:** Feed corresponding asset PNG from `03_assets.md` to Kling AI
2. **Text Prompt:** Copy exact prompt from "Text Prompt" column above
3. **Camera Setting:** Apply specified camera move from "Camera Move" column
4. **Creativity Value:** Set to specified value (0.5-0.7 range)
5. **Duration:** Hard lock to 5.0 seconds
6. **Negative Prompt:** Apply Global Negative Prompt to ALL clips

### Key Constraints:
- **5-Second Hard Limit:** No exceptions - every clip exactly 5.0 seconds
- **Single Micro-Movement:** Each prompt describes ONE subtle action only
- **Image Anchor First:** Always describe the source image before adding motion
- **No Morphing:** Creativity values kept conservative (max 0.7) to prevent deformation
- **Atmosphere Consistency:** Weather/fog mentioned in every prompt for continuity

### Camera Movement Strategy:
- **Static Hold (40%):** Clips 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16 - builds tension, allows detail
- **Slow Movement (50%):** Clips 1, 4, 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 - adds cinematic quality
- **Dynamic Tracking (10%):** Clips 2, 12 - reserved for action moments

### Creativity Value Guidelines:
- **0.5 (Default):** Standard for character close-ups, environments, subtle movements
- **0.6:** Moderate action (flying, leaping, defeated poses)
- **0.7:** High-energy only (explosions, electrical effects) - maximum safe value
- **Never exceed 0.7:** Risk of morphing/deformation increases exponentially

### Continuity Checks:
✅ **Fog/Mist:** Present in clips 1-11, dissipating clips 12-15, gone clips 16-18
✅ **Lighting:** Cool blue-green (clips 1-6) → neutral (7-14) → warm golden (15-18)
✅ **Smoke:** Only present in clips 9-14 (post-explosion sequence)
✅ **Electrical Effects:** Clips 6-7 (charge), 15 (dome), 16 (field proximity)

### Asset Reuse Optimization:
**High Reuse Assets (generate once, use multiple times):**
- `pikachu_elder_defensive.png` - Used in clips 14, 15 (x4 each = 8 instances)
- `pikachu_elder_perched.png` - Used in clips 3 (x3), 18 (x4 = 7 instances)
- `env_crater_smoking.png` - Used in clips 9, 12, 13 (background plate)

**Single Use Assets:**
- All juvenile Pikachu variants (each appears once)
- Fearow variants (one per clip)
- Most environment plates

### File Delivery Format:
When generating clips, use this naming convention:
- `clip_01_forest_establishing.mp4`
- `clip_02_juvenile_walking.mp4`
- `clip_03_elders_watching.mp4`
- ... through ...
- `clip_18_colony_together.mp4`

### Quality Assurance Checklist:
Before finalizing each clip, verify:
- [ ] Duration exactly 5.0 seconds (not 4.9, not 5.1)
- [ ] Motion matches single micro-movement described
- [ ] No morphing/deformation of characters
- [ ] Camera move matches specification
- [ ] Atmosphere consistent with Global Atmosphere Block
- [ ] Negative prompt applied
- [ ] Asset matches clip requirement from mapping table

## Emergency Troubleshooting:

**If Kling hallucinates/morphs character:**
- Reduce creativity value by 0.1
- Simplify motion description (use fewer verbs)
- Re-emphasize "holds position" in prompt

**If motion is too fast/jerky:**
- Add "slow motion" or "subtle" to motion description
- Reduce number of moving elements in prompt
- Check if source image pose is too transitional

**If atmosphere doesn't match:**
- Verify Global Atmosphere Block included in asset generation
- Check lighting/fog consistency across source images
- Re-generate asset with corrected atmosphere

**If camera move glitches:**
- Revert to "Static Hold" as safe fallback
- Reduce speed descriptor ("very slow pan" instead of "pan")
- Some camera moves work better with certain shot types (orbit requires space)
