| **08** | **Shot Type:** Close-up profile<br>**Subject:** Pikachu's eyes darting to iron ore deposits embedded in cliff wall<br>**Environment:** Crystalline hematite formations catching dawn light, metallic veins visible<br>**Note:** Reflection of iron deposits in Pikachu's eyes, realization dawning | "Pikachu notices the iron ore deposits embedded in the cliff." | 8s |
| **09** | **Shot Type:** Medium action<br>**Subject:** Pikachu pressing paws against cliff face, electricity flowing into rock<br>**Environment:** Current visible traveling through iron ore pathways, glowing veins spreading<br>**Note:** Energy transfer visible as pulsing light through stone, paws sparking | "It redirects current into the cliff face beneath its paws." | 8s |
| **10** | **Shot Type:** Macro detail<br>**Subject:** Iron fragments trembling as magnetic fields build around them<br>**Environment:** Individual ore pieces vibrating against stone, dust shaking loose<br>**Note:** Rough metallic surfaces beginning to levitate, magnetic distortion visible | "Iron fragments begin trembling as magnetic fields build around them." | 8s |
| **11** | **Shot Type:** Wide supernatural<br>**Subject:** Sharp metallic shards lifting slowly into air surrounding the defender<br>**Environment:** Magnetic field visible as heat distortion, dawn light breaking<br>**Note:** Jagged iron pieces suspended in defensive formation around Pikachu | "Sharp metallic shards lift slowly into air surrounding the defender." | 8s |
| **12** | **Shot Type:** Medium reaction<br>**Subject:** Sandslash pausing confused by shifting magnetic forces surrounding them<br>**Environment:** Metal dust swirling around their feet, static electricity in air<br>**Note:** Sandpaper skin reacting to magnetic pull, hesitation visible in stance | "The Sandslash pause confused by shifting magnetic forces surrounding them." | 8s |
| **13** | **Shot Type:** Action wide<br>**Subject:** Pikachu releasing field sending projectiles toward the invaders<br>**Environment:** Iron shards flying like bullets through dust clouds, sparks trailing<br>**Note:** Metallic projectiles in motion blur, magnetic release visible | "Pikachu releases the field sending the projectiles toward the invaders." | 8s |
| **14** | **Shot Type:** Tracking shot<br>**Subject:** Sandslash retreating before iron hail scratching their armored hides<br>**Environment:** Sparks flying from metal impacts, dust settling, retreat visible<br>**Note:** Damage visible on steel-hard scales, iron fragments bouncing off | "The Sandslash retreat before iron hail scratching their armored hides." | 8s |
| **15** | **Shot Type:** Close-up portrait<br>**Subject:** Victory at cost as smoke rises from overheated cheeks<br>**Environment:** Steam rising in dawn light, fur singed and smoking<br>**Note:** Burnt fur texture, glowing red skin visible beneath, exhaustion | "Victory comes at cost as smoke rises from overheated cheeks." | 8s |
| **16** | **Shot Type:** Aerial descent<br>**Subject:** Fearow descending from above sensing exhausted mouse vulnerability<br>**Environment:** Wings spread wide, shadow falling over Pikachu, feathers detailed<br>**Note:** Feather texture and sharp beak visible, predatory eye contact | "A Fearow descends from above sensing the exhausted mouse vulnerability." | 8s |
| **17** | **Shot Type:** Wide peril<br>**Subject:** Pikachu standing trapped on cliff edge with empty reserves<br>**Environment:** Precarious ledge, drop visible below, dawn breaking behind<br>**Note:** Exhausted posture, fur drooping, tail limp, cornered stance | "Pikachu stands trapped on the cliff edge with empty reserves." | 8s |
| **18** | **Shot Type:** Orbital tracking<br>**Subject:** Scavenger circling waiting for inevitable collapse of defenses<br>**Environment:** Circular flight pattern above, Pikachu below on cliff<br>**Note:** Predatory circling motion, wings in motion blur, waiting posture | "The scavenger circles waiting for the inevitable collapse of defenses." | 8s |

All look good. I should verify the word counts one more time to be absolutely sure.

Scene 15 check: "Victory comes at cost as smoke rises from overheated cheeks."
- Victory(1) comes(2) at(3) cost(4) as(5) smoke(6) rises(7) from(8) overheated(9) cheeks(10).
- 10 words, 1 period. (10/2) + 2 + 1 = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. ✓

Scene 16 check: "A Fearow descends from above sensing the exhausted mouse vulnerability."
- A(1) Fearow(2) descends(3) from(4) above(5) sensing(6) the(7) exhausted(8) mouse(9) vulnerability(10).
- 10 words, 1 period. 8 seconds. ✓

Everything looks correct. I'll format the final output now. </think>**Title:** The Static Siege
