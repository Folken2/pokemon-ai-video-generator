# Kling 2.5 Shot List: "First Flight"

**Technical Notes:**
- All clips generate 10.0 seconds (trimmed to 8s in post)
- Micro-movement philosophy: "breathing photographs" (EXCEPT Clip 02 - action shot)
- Camera movement at END of every prompt
- Composite seed images used for two-character scenes

## The Kling 2.5 Shot List

| Clip # | Character Asset | Motion + Context Prompt | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | `composites/clip_01_challenge.png` | "Young Charmeleon climbs volcanic rock toward dominant Charizard above. Charmeleon's chest heaves with heavy breathing. Charmeleon's tail flame blazes bright orange-gold. Charizard stands silhouetted on ridge above, wings partially spread in territorial display. Heat shimmer rises from black basalt. Golden hour light casts long dramatic shadows. Both creatures' flames flicker. Slow push in." | Two-character establishing shot. Size contrast critical - Charizard twice size of Charmeleon. |
| **02** | `composites/clip_02_faceoff.png` | "Charizard and Charmeleon face off on volcanic ridge. Charizard swings massive tail in powerful whip strike. Tail connects with Charmeleon's side. Charmeleon tumbles backward across volcanic rock. Scales scrape against basalt. Sparks fly from impact. Dust and ash kick up around fallen Charmeleon. Charmeleon's flame dims on impact. Charizard's flame burns steady and dominant. Slow zoom in." | ACTION SHOT - breaks micro-movement rule. The fight sequence. Victory absolute. |
| **03** | `composites/clip_03_exile.png` | "Wounded Charmeleon limps slowly away into the distance. Tail drags across volcanic rock. Head hangs low with exhaustion. Wound visible on flank. Above on ridge, dominant Charizard watches motionless. Charizard's wings folded, flame steady. Long sunset shadows stretch across terrain. Sky glows orange and purple. Vast empty landscape ahead of Charmeleon. Slow pull back." | Two-character exile shot. Victor watches defeated leave. Isolation emphasized. |
| **04** | `charmeleon_still_cliff.png` | "Charmeleon stands motionless on cliff edge at night. Body completely still except for breathing. Tail flame intensifies from orange to bright gold, growing brighter. Flame casts dancing shadows on rock. Stars visible in dark sky above. Distant volcanic vents glow faint orange on horizon. Slow zoom in." | Transformation beginning. Only the flame moves, growing brighter. |
| **05** | `charmeleon_transformation_beginning.png` | "Charmeleon stands with swollen shoulder lumps visible beneath skin. Lumps pulse with subtle internal movement. Skin stretched thin over forming wing buds. Steam rises from overheated body into cold pre-dawn air. Tail flame burns bright gold casting harsh light. Eyes squeeze partially shut with discomfort. Slow zoom in." | Body horror texture. Skin ready to split. |
| **06** | `charmeleon_wings_emerging.png` | "Wing membranes emerge from torn shoulder skin. Wet compressed membranes slowly unfurl like crumpled paper smoothing. Blood vessels pulse visibly through translucent membrane. Fluid glistens and drips from emergence points. Tail flame flares erratically bright then dim. Mouth open in silent expression of pain. Slow zoom in." | Macro detail on wet membrane texture. Most visceral shot. |
| **07** | `charmeleon_wings_emerging.png` | "Creature remains fixed in position on cliff edge. Wings continue unfurling slowly. Body trembles with transformation strain. Steam rises continuously from overheated form. Pre-dawn light gradually brightens across the scene. Tail flame pulses rhythmically with metabolic exertion. Slow pull back." | Time-lapse effect suggested through lighting shift. Consider multiple clips stitched for full day/night cycle. |
| **08** | `charizard_new_dawn_damp_core.png` | "Newly evolved Charizard stands at cliff edge at dawn. Wings still damp and glistening catch pink-gold morning light. Eyes slowly open for first time at new height. Chest heaves with exhausted breathing. Steam rises from warm body. Morning mist drifts in valley far below. Slow zoom out." | Rebirth reveal. Warm hopeful lighting. Creature looks exhausted but reborn. |
| **09** | `charizard_new_looking_down.png` | "New Charizard stands at cliff edge looking down into vast drop. Wings twitch uncertainly at sides. Talons grip rock edge tightly. Weight shifts slightly backward with hesitation. Thermal columns rise as visible heat distortion from below. Tail flame burns steady orange. Slow tilt down." | Vertigo POV. Emphasize height and hesitation. |
| **10** | `charizard_new_stepping_off.png` | "Charizard's front talons lift from rock edge. Body tips forward into empty air. Wings remain folded against body. Weight commits forward past point of return. Tail flame streams horizontally behind with forward momentum. Morning sky fills background. Slow zoom out." | Decision moment. Slow-motion feel. No turning back. |
| **11** | `charizard_new_wings_open.png` | "Charizard in mid-air as wings snap fully open. Massive wing membranes stretch taut catching rushing air. Body jerks from vertical to horizontal orientation. First clumsy wingbeat begins. Thermal column visible as heat shimmer supports the rise. Tail flame trails behind like comet. Slow tilt up." | Money shot. The snap moment when instinct takes over. |
| **12** | `composites/clip_12_two_charizards.png` | "Young Charizard spirals upward in thermal column in lower sky. Wings spread wide catching rising hot air. Body banks in turning ascent. Tail flame trails in spiral pattern. Above on distant mountain peak, old dominant Charizard turns and walks away. Old Charizard's wings folded, departing frame. Blue morning sky. Two Charizards - one rising, one retreating. Slow pull back." | Two-character finale. Parallel framing. The cycle continues. |

## Production Notes

### Clip 02 - Action Shot Exception

**This clip intentionally breaks the micro-movement rule.**

The script requires showing:
- Charizard's tail whip connecting
- Charmeleon tumbling from impact
- "The fight is brief. Victory absolute."

This dramatic action is necessary for story impact. The prompt describes the full tail whip sequence rather than a static aftermath.

### Clip 07 - Time-lapse Consideration

- Script calls for 48-hour time-lapse with day/night cycle
- Single Kling clip cannot show full day/night transition
- Options:
  1. Generate multiple clips with different lighting, stitch in post
  2. Use subtle lighting shift within single clip (pre-dawn to dawn)

### Camera Movement Summary

| Clip | Camera Movement | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | Slow push in | Entering the scene, building tension |
| 02 | Slow zoom in | Focus on action impact, increasing intensity |
| 03 | Slow pull back | Departing, showing isolation and scale |
| 04 | Slow zoom in | Building internal transformation |
| 05 | Slow zoom in | Focusing on body horror detail |
| 06 | Slow zoom in | Macro detail emphasis |
| 07 | Slow pull back | Showing passage of time, wider context |
| 08 | Slow zoom out | Reveal of new form, showing scale |
| 09 | Slow tilt down | Following gaze into the drop |
| 10 | Slow zoom out | Showing commitment, departure from safety |
| 11 | Slow tilt up | Following ascent, triumphant rise |
| 12 | Slow pull back | Final departure, closing out story |

## Global Atmosphere Reminder

All clips should maintain consistent atmosphere:
- Volcanic mountain range at high elevation
- Heat shimmer and thermal distortion
- Sulfurous haze filtering light
- Black basalt rock formations
- Sparse twisted vegetation
- National Geographic wildlife documentary aesthetic
