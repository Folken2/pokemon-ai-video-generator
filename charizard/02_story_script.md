| Scene # | Visual Prompt (for Kling 2.5) | Audio Script (for ElevenLabs) | Est. Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Shot Type:** Wide establishing<br>**Subject:** Young Charmeleon climbing volcanic ridge toward dominant Charizard silhouette above. Charmeleon's posture aggressive, tail flame blazing.<br>**Environment:** Volcanic mountain at golden hour. Heat shimmer rising from black basalt. Orange sky, sulfur haze.<br>**Note:** Size contrast critical—Charizard twice the size of Charmeleon. | "The young Charmeleon challenges the fire king of the mountain." | 8s |
| **02** | **Shot Type:** Medium tracking<br>**Subject:** Charizard's tail whip connects with Charmeleon's side. Charmeleon sent tumbling across volcanic rock, scales scraping, sparks flying.<br>**Environment:** Dust and ash kicked up. Charizard's shadow looming over fallen Charmeleon.<br>**Note:** Impact should feel heavy. Charmeleon's flame dims momentarily on impact. | "The fight is brief. Victory absolute." | 8s |
| **03** | **Shot Type:** Wide retreating<br>**Subject:** Wounded Charmeleon limping away from camera, tail dragging, blood visible on flank. Dominant Charizard watches from ridge above, flame burning steady.<br>**Environment:** Sunset behind mountains. Long shadows. Charmeleon descending into valley.<br>**Note:** Isolation emphasized—vast empty landscape ahead of Charmeleon. | "Defeated and bleeding the challenger is driven from the mountain." | 8s |
| **04** | **Shot Type:** Wide establishing<br>**Subject:** Charmeleon alone on isolated cliff edge. Motionless. Tail flame beginning to intensify from orange to bright gold.<br>**Environment:** Night falling. Stars emerging. Volcanic steam vents glowing in distance. Cliff drops into darkness below.<br>**Note:** Stillness is key. Only the flame moves, growing brighter. | "Alone on a distant cliff something inside begins to change." | 8s |
| **05** | **Shot Type:** Medium close-up<br>**Subject:** Charmeleon's shoulder blades swelling visibly beneath the skin. Lumps pulsing. Skin stretching thin enough to see dark shapes beneath.<br>**Environment:** Pre-dawn darkness. Tail flame now casting harsh golden light. Steam rising from Charmeleon's body.<br>**Note:** Body horror texture—skin should look ready to split. | "This is not the magic of fairy tales but metamorphosis." | 8s |
| **06** | **Shot Type:** Extreme close-up macro<br>**Subject:** Wing membranes tearing through shoulder skin. Wet, compressed, blood-streaked. Membranes slowly unfurling like crumpled paper smoothing. Visible blood vessels pulsing.<br>**Environment:** Charmeleon's mouth open in silent scream. Tail flame flaring erratically.<br>**Note:** Texture emphasis—wet membrane, torn skin edges, glistening fluid. | "The wings tear through flesh still wet and violently trembling." | 8s |
| **07** | **Shot Type:** Time-lapse wide<br>**Subject:** Charmeleon's body transforming over hours. Neck elongating. Skull reshaping. Horns pushing outward. Body mass increasing. Day/night cycle visible in background.<br>**Environment:** Sun rises, sets, rises again. Clouds pass. Stars wheel. The creature never moves from its spot.<br>**Note:** Show passage of time through lighting changes while creature remains fixed. | "For forty eight hours it does not sleep or eat." | 8s |
| **08** | **Shot Type:** Wide reveal<br>**Subject:** Dawn light hits the cliff. Where Charmeleon stood, a Charizard now stands. Wings still damp, glistening. New orange hide catching first sunlight. Eyes opening.<br>**Environment:** Pink and gold dawn sky. Morning mist in valley below. Steam rising from the new Charizard's body.<br>**Note:** Rebirth moment—light should feel warm and hopeful but creature looks exhausted. | "At dawn something new and terrible stands at the edge." | 8s |
| **09** | **Shot Type:** Over-shoulder POV<br>**Subject:** New Charizard looking down over cliff edge. Camera behind, showing vast drop below. Wings twitch uncertainly. Talons grip rock.<br>**Environment:** Thousand-foot drop visible. Morning thermals beginning to rise—visible heat distortion columns.<br>**Note:** Vertigo shot. Emphasize the height and the creature's hesitation. | "Below this creature waits a thousand feet of empty air." | 8s |
| **10** | **Shot Type:** Side profile medium<br>**Subject:** Charizard steps forward off the cliff edge. Front talons leaving rock. Body tipping into freefall. Wings still folded.<br>**Environment:** Cliff edge in foreground, open sky behind. The moment of commitment.<br>**Note:** Slow-motion feel. The decision point. No turning back. | "It makes its choice and steps forward off the edge." | 8s |
| **11** | **Shot Type:** Tracking fall to flight<br>**Subject:** Charizard in freefall, tumbling, wings snapping open instinctively. Membranes catching air. Body jerking horizontal. First clumsy wingbeat. Rising.<br>**Environment:** Rushing air. Ground approaching then receding. Thermal column visible as heat shimmer.<br>**Note:** Transformation from falling to flying—the snap moment when instinct takes over. | "Freefall. Then ancient instinct takes hold." | 8s |
| **12** | **Shot Type:** Wide aerial<br>**Subject:** New Charizard spiraling upward in thermal column, wings spread wide, still clumsy but flying. Above on distant peak, the old dominant Charizard watches. Then turns and walks away.<br>**Environment:** Full morning light. Blue sky. Two Charizards—one ascending, one retreating.<br>**Note:** Parallel framing—young one rising, old one departing. The cycle continues. | "The rematch will come. But not today." | 8s |

## Key Production Notes

### Kling 2.5 Considerations
- **Scene 06** (wing emergence) requires macro detail—test with still image first
- **Scene 07** (time-lapse) may need multiple clips stitched for day/night cycle
- **Scene 11** (fall-to-flight) is the "money shot"—allocate extra generation attempts

### ElevenLabs Considerations
- Attenborough voice profile
- Scenes 10-11 should have slight tempo increase for tension
- Scene 12 closing line should have finality/weight

### Seed Image Requirements
- Scene 01: Charmeleon vs Charizard size reference
- Scene 06: Wing membrane texture reference (bat wing, blood vessels)
- Scene 08: "New Charizard at dawn" hero shot
- Scene 12: Two Charizards at different elevations
