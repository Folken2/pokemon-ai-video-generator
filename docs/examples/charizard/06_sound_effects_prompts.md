# Sound Effects Prompts - "First Flight"

**Pokemon:** Charizard
**Episode:** First Flight
**Total Clips:** 12
**Duration per Clip:** 10 seconds

---

## Sound Design Overview

**General Environment:** Volcanic mountain range - rugged basalt terrain, sulfurous vents, thermal columns, high altitude winds, dramatic cliffs overlooking vast valleys.

**Key Sound Elements:**
- Volcanic ambience (rumbling, hissing steam vents, crackling hot rock)
- Mountain wind (constant high-altitude gusts, whistling through rocks)
- Fire crackling (tail flames, heat distortion)
- Rock/stone surfaces (scraping, footsteps on basalt)
- Dawn/dusk atmospheric transitions

**Character Sounds:**
- Charmeleon/Charizard: Heavy reptilian breathing, clawed footsteps on rock, wing membrane rustling, fire crackling from tail
- Body transformation: Wet tearing sounds, bone cracking, membrane stretching

**Mood Progression:**
- Act 1 (01-03): Aggressive tension → brutal impact → lonely defeat
- Act 2 (04-08): Quiet isolation → building intensity → visceral transformation → triumphant dawn
- Act 3 (09-12): Vertigo tension → moment of commitment → exhilarating flight → peaceful resolution
