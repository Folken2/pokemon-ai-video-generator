| Scene # | Visual Prompt (for Kling 2.5) | Audio Script (for ElevenLabs) | Est. Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Shot Type:** Wide establishing shot, low angle<br>**Subject:** Bulbasaur emerging from fern cover into open wetland clearing, morning mist swirling around its legs<br>**Environment:** Golden morning light filtering through fog, wet grass glistening with dew, scattered puddles reflecting sky. Dappled sunlight visible 30 feet ahead in clearing center.<br>**Note:** Emphasize slow, deliberate waddle. Bulb sways with each step. | "In the wetland margins survival demands a calculated risk." | 8s |
| **02** | **Shot Type:** Extreme close-up macro<br>**Subject:** Bulbasaur's bulb surface - waxy green petals with faint purple-pink undertones, tiny trichomes (hair-like structures) visible on petal edges<br>**Environment:** Soft diffused morning light illuminating bulb texture. Single water droplet sliding down petal surface.<br>**Note:** Focus on texture detail - waxy sheen, slight translucency where light penetrates. | "This juvenile's bulb has matured but remains untested in combat." | 8s |
| **03** | **Shot Type:** Drone shot, high angle descending<br>**Subject:** Bulbasaur crossing open ground toward sunny patch, leaving clear trail through wet grass<br>**Environment:** Aerial view shows surrounding fern cover, the exposed 40-foot clearing, and distant tree line. Shadows of birds circling overhead visible on ground.<br>**Note:** Camera descends slowly, revealing scale of vulnerability. | "Five days of rain have passed and photosynthesis is critical." | 8s |
| **04** | **Shot Type:** Tracking shot, side profile<br>**Subject:** Spearow diving from above frame, wings tucked, beak extended. Motion blur on wingtips.<br>**Environment:** Blurred green/brown background (speed effect). Sharp focus on Spearow's predatory expression - black eyes locked on target.<br>**Note:** Speed and aggression. Feathers bristling, talons extended forward. | "But open ground attracts those who hunt from above." | 8s |
| **05** | **Shot Type:** Slow-motion close-up, impact moment<br>**Subject:** Spearow's talons grazing Bulbasaur's bulb surface - three parallel scratch marks appearing on waxy green petals<br>**Environment:** Motion frozen at moment of contact. Water droplets suspended in air from impact splash. Sunlight catching talon edges.<br>**Note:** NO blood, but clear physical damage - petals torn slightly, exposed lighter green tissue beneath. | "The first strike tests the bulb's defenses." | 8s |
| **06** | **Shot Type:** Ground-level wide shot<br>**Subject:** Bulbasaur hunched low, Spearow circling overhead in tight spiral (3-4 positions blur-composited to show flight path)<br>**Environment:** Open clearing, Bulbasaur 15 feet from safety of fern cover. Sunny patch still 10 feet ahead. Spearow's shadow repeatedly crossing Bulbasaur's position.<br>**Note:** Show isolation - predator has aerial advantage, prey is exposed. | "Retreating to cover means starvation within forty-eight hours." | 8s |
| **07** | **Shot Type:** Extreme close-up, Bulbasaur's eye<br>**Subject:** Large red sclera with vertical black slit pupil. Eye tracks upward, following Spearow's movement. Nictitating membrane partially closed.<br>**Environment:** Blurred green/brown background (ground level perspective). Reflection of circling bird barely visible in eye's surface moisture.<br>**Note:** No emotion - just cold calculation. Pupil dilates slightly. | "Standing ground is death or the proving of poison." | 8s |
| **08** | **Shot Type:** Wide shot, low angle from behind Bulbasaur<br>**Subject:** Bulbasaur completely motionless in center frame. Spearow descending rapidly from top of frame, wings spreading to brake for landing on bulb.<br>**Environment:** Backlit by morning sun - Bulbasaur silhouetted, Spearow's wings glowing orange at edges. Mist wisps around scene.<br>**Note:** Moment of commitment - prey accepts predator's approach. Freeze last frame before contact. | "The juvenile makes its choice and becomes perfectly still." | 8s |
| **09** | **Shot Type:** Extreme close-up macro, slow-motion (critical scene)<br>**Subject:** Spearow's talons piercing bulb surface. Bulb petals instantly flare open (like flower blooming in fast-forward). Explosion of purple-green poison powder erupting from exposed trichomes - particles catching light like glitter.<br>**Environment:** Shallow depth of field - sharp focus on penetration point, powder cloud blooming outward in shimmering haze. Golden backlight makes particles glow.<br>**Note:** THIS IS THE MONEY SHOT. Slow-motion (0.25x speed). Visible particles, heat distortion effect from toxin concentration. | "Contact triggers the release of neurotoxic alkaloid powder." | 8s |
| **10** | **Shot Type:** Medium shot, side profile<br>**Subject:** Spearow mid-screech, beak open, wings frozen extended. Purple-green powder coating entire body - concentrated on face and open beak. Eyes wide, pupils dilated in shock.<br>**Environment:** Powder cloud still hanging in air, backlit and shimmering. Bulbasaur visible in background, bulb still flared open.<br>**Note:** Capture moment of paralysis onset - body rigid, feathers ruffled unnaturally. No motion blur (bird is locked). | "Paralysis begins within seconds." | 8s |
| **11** | **Shot Type:** Wide ground-level shot<br>**Subject:** Spearow collapsed on wet grass 6 feet from Bulbasaur, one wing twisted underneath body, chest heaving rapidly. Bulbasaur stands in sunny patch in background, bulb closed, photosynthesizing (faint golden glow around bulb edges).<br>**Environment:** Morning mist clearing, sunlight fully illuminating clearing. Faint purple powder residue visible on grass and Bulbasaur's skin. Paras visible at clearing edge, scavenging.<br>**Note:** Resolution - predator defeated, prey survives and achieves original goal (sunlight). | "The ecosystem accepts a new defender of the wetlands." | 8s |

## Production Notes

### Lore Grounding
Every scene element is derived from canonical sources:
- Wetland habitat → Research: "thrives in wetland margins"
- Morning hunting → Research: "Spearow: aerial predators that target juvenile Bulbasaur"
- Bulb texture details → Research: "waxy succulent leaves, trichomes filled with alkaloid toxins"
- Poison Powder mechanics → Research: "flares open, releases cloud of particles settling in 15-foot radius"
- Photosynthesis need → Pokédex: "can draw energy from the bulb on its back"

### Key Visual Priorities for Asset Generation
1. **Scene 09 (Poison Explosion):** This is the climax - requires slow-motion particle effects, precise timing
2. **Scene 02 (Bulb Macro):** Establishes texture language for entire piece
3. **Scene 07 (Eye Close-up):** Conveys decision moment without dialogue
4. **Scene 11 (Resolution):** Must show both defeated predator AND successful photosynthesis goal

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Waxy green (bulb), bluish-green (amphibian skin), purple-green (poison powder)
- **Secondary:** Golden morning light, orange backlight (sunrise), brown/tan (Spearow)
- **Accent:** Red eyes (Bulbasaur), black pupils, wet grass reflections

### Audio Pacing
All 11 scenes use 10-word, 1-period structure for consistency. Attenborough voice should emphasize:
- **Scenes 1-4:** Building tension (neutral, observational)
- **Scenes 5-7:** Calculation and stakes (slightly slower, weightier)
- **Scenes 8-9:** Climax (dramatic pause before "Contact triggers")
- **Scenes 10-11:** Resolution (return to neutral, accepting tone)

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to asset generation (Phase 3: `3_asset_generator.md`)
2. Generate seed images for each scene using research visual descriptions
3. Run Kling 2.5 video generation with prompts above
4. Generate ElevenLabs audio using exact scripts (verify 8s duration per line)
5. Trim/sequence in post-production
