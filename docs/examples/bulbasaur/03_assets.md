## Part 4: Master Prompts

### BULBASAUR ASSETS

#### Bulbasaur (Walking Forward Through Clearing) [CORE]

```
Bulbasaur maintains its iconic Pokemon appearance: compact quadrupedal body structure roughly 2 feet tall and 2.5 feet long, resembling a robust Galápagos tortoise hatchling crossed with a stocky poison dart frog. The body has a low center of gravity with thick muscular limbs positioned in wide stable stance. LARGE prominent bulb structure on the back - this bulb is a separate physical element, appearing as a closed tulip-like formation with tightly-packed waxy green petals showing faint purple-pink undertones where morning light penetrates through the translucent edges.

The amphibian skin texture resembles wet moss on stone - bluish-green matte surface with slight moisture sheen, cool and slick appearance. Irregular darker green patches cover the skin like lichen patterns or cracked dried mud, providing natural camouflage texture. The skin has subtle organic surface detail similar to smooth tree frog skin with visible pores.

The bulb petals have waxy succulent leaf texture - firm, smooth with subtle sheen like jade plant leaves. Tiny hair-like trichomes are barely visible along petal edges in the macro detail. The bulb is physically attached to the back, showing clear separation from the body as a distinct botanical structure.

LARGE EYES are a dominant feature - red sclera with vertical black slit pupils similar to tomato frogs, providing wide-angle predator detection. Eyes face forward in alert expression.

The creature is in stable walking pose: front right leg and back left leg forward mid-stride, weight balanced evenly across all four limbs. Blunt claws visible, worn smooth like polished river pebbles from digging. Bulb sways slightly with the walking motion but pose is frozen in neutral forward movement.

Scale: 2 feet tall at bulb peak, approximately 15 pounds in apparent weight, low to ground.

Early morning (6:00-7:00 AM) golden hour just after sunrise. Post-rain clearing conditions, humidity 85%, temperature cool (~55°F). Volumetric morning light filtering through dissipating mist, creating visible god rays and shafts of golden illumination. Soft diffused ambient light with warm orange-gold directional highlights from low-angle sun. Shallow depth of field with natural bokeh on background elements. Temperate rainforest wetland margin with dense fern undergrowth surrounding clearing. Rich loamy dark brown-black soil. Morning mist swirling at ground level (2-3 feet high). Water droplets on grass blades creating prismatic sparkles. Shot on Arri Alexa LF with Zeiss Supreme Prime 35mm lens, anamorphic bokeh. Warm gold and orange sunrise tones balanced against cool blue-green forest shadows.

#### Bulbasaur (Bulb Close-up - Macro Detail)

```
Extreme macro close-up of Bulbasaur's bulb structure in static neutral state. The bulb is a separate physical botanical element attached to the creature's back, resembling a closed amaryllis or tulip bulb formation. Tightly-packed waxy green petals with firm succulent texture, smooth surface showing subtle sheen like jade plant leaves. Faint purple-pink undertones visible where morning light penetrates translucent petal edges.

Microscopic detail shows tiny hair-like trichomes along petal edges and seams - these are specialized structures that will release poison powder when triggered. Surface has natural imperfections: slight creases where petals overlap, organic texture variation, tiny water droplet sliding down one petal catching golden light.

Petals are closed in resting state but show anatomical structure - multiple layers visible, thickest at base where bulb attaches to creature's bluish-green amphibian skin. The attachment point shows clear botanical integration, like a grafted plant with visible connection tissue.

Color: Waxy green primary color with purple-pink gradient at edges and petal tips. Morning dew droplet shows prismatic refraction.

Early morning golden hour light. Volumetric mist wisps in background (out of focus bokeh). Soft diffused illumination with warm highlights. Shot on Arri Alexa LF with Zeiss Supreme Prime 100mm macro lens, extreme shallow depth of field, anamorphic bokeh on background.

### SPEAROW ASSETS

#### Spearow (Mid-Dive Attack) [CORE]

```
Spearow maintains its iconic Pokemon proportions: small compact raptor body approximately 12 inches tall with aggressive predatory build. The body structure resembles a Cooper's hawk or sharp-shinned hawk - built for speed and agility with compact muscular frame. LARGE WINGS are the dominant feature when extended, spanning approximately 30 inches tip-to-tip with sharp angular profile.

Feather texture is realistic bird plumage: brown primary feathers with tan/cream striping on wing undersides, creating natural hawk barring pattern. Chest and belly show cream-colored feathers with brown speckled markings (similar to juvenile hawk plumage). Flight feathers have subtle iridescence where light catches edges - deep brown with hints of bronze.

Head structure: sharp hooked beak colored dark gray-black (keratin texture), LARGE black eyes with predatory forward-facing focus showing hunting intensity. Small pointed crest feathers on head crown (signature Spearow feature maintained). Tan/cream facial markings around eye and cheek.

Body feathers show realistic texture: overlapping scapular feathers on back creating scale-like pattern, softer downy feathers on chest, long stiff flight feathers on wings. Natural weathering and imperfections - some feathers slightly ruffled or out of place showing active hunting wear.

Talons extended forward aggressively: dark gray-black scaly texture on legs, sharp curved black talons spread wide for striking. Each talon approximately 0.5 inches long, hooked like fishing hooks.

Pose: Diving attack position frozen in moment of descent. Wings partially tucked, body angled 45 degrees downward, talons extended forward, beak pointed at target. Stable dynamic pose suitable for subtle wing-edge flutter animation.

Early morning golden hour wetland clearing. Volumetric mist. Background blurred showing green/brown forest colors (motion blur effect from speed). Shot on Arri Alexa LF with 35mm lens tracking fast movement, slight motion blur on wing tips only, sharp focus on head and talons.

#### Spearow (Talon Strike Close-up)

```
Extreme macro close-up of Spearow's talons in moment of contact with Bulbasaur's bulb surface. Talons are the dominant focal point: dark gray-black scaly texture on bird legs (similar to chicken feet scaling but more refined hawk texture), sharp curved black talons with pointed tips piercing into waxy green petal surface.

Three talons visible in frame, spread wide, tips penetrating approximately 2-3mm into bulb petal creating small puncture indentations. The waxy green petal surface shows compression and slight tearing at penetration points - NOT blood, but physical damage to plant tissue revealing lighter green underlayer.

Talon detail: keratin texture showing natural ridges and slight weathering, black coloration with dark gray base where talon emerges from scaled leg. Sharp hooked curve, approximately 0.5 inches long each.

Bulb texture in contact zone: waxy succulent surface with firm resistance, slight compression visible around impact points. Tiny trichomes (hair-like structures) on petal edges just beginning to release - microscopic powder particles barely visible as shimmer.

Frozen moment of impact - NO motion, static contact state suitable for subtle micro-movement (pressure settling, powder beginning to drift).

Early morning golden hour light. Macro shallow depth of field - talons and immediate contact point sharp, background completely blurred. Shot on Arri Alexa LF with 100mm macro lens, extreme close focus.

#### Spearow (Paralyzed Mid-Screech)

```
REFERENCE: Use spearow_dive_core.png as reference to maintain EXACT same appearance - same brown/tan hawk plumage, same features. MATCH THE EXACT appearance from reference.

Spearow frozen in moment of paralysis: body rigid in unnatural suspended position mid-air approximately 2 feet above ground. Wings extended but locked at awkward asymmetrical angles (left wing higher than right, showing paralysis disrupting natural flight control). Beak open wide in screech position, showing pink mouth interior and dark tongue.

Eyes wide open with pupils dilated in shock - black eyes showing biological distress response. Head tilted at slight unnatural angle due to neck muscle paralysis.

Feathers ruffled and disorganized from paralysis - no longer showing smooth aerodynamic alignment. Some feathers standing on end unnaturally. Talons clenched rigid.

Purple-green poison powder coating entire body heavily: visible powder particles clinging to feathers especially concentrated on face, open beak, and chest areas. Powder appears as fine dust/pollen-like particles with slight shimmer, heaviest concentration where bird made contact with bulb.

Body shows no motion - complete paralysis, held rigid in mid-air moment. Pose is static unnatural suspension.

Background shows purple-green poison cloud still hanging in air (backlit, shimmering haze), Bulbasaur visible behind bird with bulb still flared open (out of focus).

Early morning golden hour with backlighting making powder particles glow. Shot on Arri Alexa LF with 35mm lens, moderate depth of field.

#### Spearow (Collapsed on Ground)

```
REFERENCE: Use spearow_dive_core.png as reference to maintain EXACT same appearance - same brown/tan plumage, same body structure. MATCH THE EXACT appearance from reference.

Spearow collapsed on wet grass and dark soil: body lying on right side with one wing twisted underneath at unnatural angle (showing injury from fall), other wing partially spread on ground. Legs extended limply, talons unclenched and relaxed. Head resting on ground, beak slightly open, one black eye visible showing rapid pupil movement (still alive but incapacitated).

Chest heaving rapidly - visible breathing motion showing distress and paralysis effects. Feathers disheveled and matted, some grass blades stuck to feathers.

Purple-green poison powder residue still faintly visible on feathers, less concentrated than previous scene (some brushed off during fall). Powder appears as light dusting on brown plumage.

Position: Lying approximately 6 feet from Bulbasaur (not visible in this tight shot), on wet morning grass showing water droplets and dark loamy soil underneath bird.

Defeated predator state - incapacitated but breathing, showing nature's brutal efficiency.

Early morning golden hour with soft side-lighting. Ground-level camera angle, shallow depth of field keeping focus on bird's head and visible eye. Background shows blurred wet grass and soil. Shot on Arri Alexa LF with 35mm lens.

### PARAS ASSETS

#### Paras (Foraging at Clearing Edge)

```
Paras maintains its iconic Pokemon appearance: compact arthropod body resembling an orange-brown crab or isopod, approximately 12 inches long. The body has realistic crustacean texture - segmented chitinous exoskeleton with orange-tan coloration and darker brown segment joints. Six legs with multiple joints, each ending in small pointed tips for gripping soil and vegetation.

LARGE RED MUSHROOM CAPS growing from the back are the dominant feature - these are TWO separate fungal fruiting bodies (Cordyceps-style parasitic mushrooms) physically attached to the creature's carapace. Mushroom caps are bright red with white spots (Amanita muscaria appearance), showing realistic fungal texture: smooth slightly moist surface with subtle gills visible on underside edges. Caps approximately 4-5 inches in diameter each.

The mushrooms are clearly parasitic growths emerging from the arthropod's back - visible mycelium threads (white fungal filaments) connecting caps to exoskeleton at attachment points. This is a symbiotic/parasitic relationship similar to Bulbasaur's seed.

Face shows small compound eyes (dark amber/red coloration) and small mandibles suitable for fungus-eating. Body posture: low to ground in stable foraging stance, legs positioned for walking on forest floor.

Pose: Stationary at clearing edge, positioned near rotting log or mushroom cluster, appearing to forage for fungal spores or decaying matter. One or two legs raised slightly as if mid-step but pose is stable and held.

Background role - this creature is scavenging at clearing edge, opportunistic presence during aftermath of predator-prey conflict.

Early morning golden hour wetland clearing edge. Soft diffused light filtering through ferns. Rich dark soil and moss visible. Shot on Arri Alexa LF with 35mm lens, moderate depth of field (Paras in focus, background slightly soft).

### PROP ASSETS

#### Poison Powder Cloud (Explosion Moment)

```
Extreme close-up macro of poison powder cloud at peak intensity explosion moment. The powder consists of microscopic particles appearing as purple-green shimmering dust suspended in air, similar to pollen or spores caught in sunlight.

Particle detail: Each particle approximately 0.1-0.5mm diameter, appearing as tiny spheres or irregular organic shapes. Color gradient from deep purple at particle cores to bright green at edges, creating overall purple-green haze appearance. Particles catch golden morning light creating prismatic sparkle effects - some particles appear to glow faintly from internal chemical composition.

Cloud formation: Explosive outward bloom pattern frozen at maximum expansion radius (approximately 3-4 feet diameter), creating spherical diffusion pattern. Density is heaviest at center (where bulb released powder) graduating to lighter concentration at edges. Individual particles visible at cloud perimeter where density is lower.

Atmospheric interaction: Powder particles interact with volumetric morning mist creating visible layering - heavier powder settling below lighter water vapor. Some particles adhering to moisture droplets in air creating small clumps.

Texture: Pollen-like organic dust, NOT smoke or gas. These are solid microscopic particles, not vapor. Similar to macro shots of dandelion seeds or pine pollen clouds but with unnatural purple-green coloration.

Background completely blurred (extreme macro bokeh) - golden morning light with hints of green (forest) and brown (soil) colors creating atmospheric backdrop for particle cloud focus.

Static moment frozen at peak dispersion - NOT actively expanding, captured at maximum bloom state suitable for subtle drift animation.

Shot on Arri Alexa LF with 100mm macro lens, f/2.8 aperture, extreme shallow depth of field. Backlit by golden morning sun creating particle edge glow.

#### Morning Mist Wisps (Atmospheric)

```
Volumetric morning mist captured at ground level (2-3 feet height) in temperate rainforest wetland clearing. The mist appears as translucent white-gray vapor wisps with organic flowing shapes, similar to fog rolling across water surface.

Mist structure: Multiple layers of vapor at different densities - thicker concentrated areas appearing more opaque white, thinner areas showing transparency revealing ground vegetation beneath. Individual wisp tendrils show subtle internal texture from water vapor density variation.

Atmospheric interaction: Mist catches golden morning sunlight creating visible god rays penetrating through vapor. Backlit areas glow warm orange-gold while shadowed areas remain cool blue-gray. Particles suspended in mist (pollen, spores) create subtle sparkle effects where light penetrates.

Ground contact: Mist flows around fern fronds, grass blades, and soil creating natural atmospheric depth. Some condensation visible on vegetation where mist touches cooler surfaces - tiny water droplets forming on leaf edges.

Color: Primarily white-gray with warm golden highlights in backlit areas and cool blue shadows. Natural color temperature variation based on light angle.

Background elements (soft focus): Dark brown-black loamy soil, green fern undergrowth, scattered puddles reflecting golden sky.

Static moment with mist in gentle settled state - NOT actively swirling, captured at calm flowing moment suitable for subtle drift animation.

Shot on Arri Alexa LF with 35mm lens, shallow-moderate depth of field. Low angle camera position (12 inches above ground) to capture mist volume. Backlit by golden sunrise creating dramatic atmosphere.

#### Wet Grass with Dew Droplets

```
Extreme macro close-up of wet grass blades in temperate wetland clearing. Multiple grass blades fill frame showing realistic botanical detail: long thin sword-shaped leaves with parallel venation, bright green coloration with subtle yellow-green highlights where backlit by morning sun.

Dew droplet detail (DOMINANT FEATURE): Dozens of water droplets clinging to grass blade surfaces and edges, ranging from tiny 1mm beads to larger 5-6mm spherical drops. Each droplet shows realistic water physics - surface tension creating perfect sphere shapes on blade edges, slight elongation where droplets cling to vertical surfaces.

Droplet optical properties: Each water bead acts as tiny lens showing:
- Prismatic light refraction creating rainbow edge highlights
- Internal reflection showing miniature inverted image of surroundings (golden sky, forest silhouette)
- Subsurface light transmission making droplets glow from within when backlit
- Slight color tinting (green from grass chlorophyll, gold from sunrise light)

Grass texture: Smooth waxy cuticle surface with subtle longitudinal ridges following leaf grain. Natural imperfections - slight browning at some blade tips, small tears or insect damage showing organic authenticity. Blades show slight curve and droop from water weight.

Some blades have multiple droplets merging together creating larger irregular water shapes. Tiny suspended particles visible inside some droplets (pollen, microscopic debris).

Background completely blurred (extreme macro bokeh) - dark brown soil and green vegetation colors creating soft atmospheric backdrop.

Static moment with droplets held in stable positions by surface tension - NOT dripping or falling, captured at calm settled state suitable for subtle gravity pull or light ripple animation.

Shot on Arri Alexa LF with 100mm macro lens, f/2.8 aperture, extreme shallow depth of field. Backlit by low-angle golden morning sun creating edge lighting and droplet glow.
