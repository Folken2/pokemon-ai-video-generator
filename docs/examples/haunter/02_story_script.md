## Production Script Table

| Scene # | Visual Prompt (for Veo 3) | Audio Script (for ElevenLabs) | Est. Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Shot Type:** Wide establishing shot, drone perspective<br>**Subject:** Derelict power station exterior at night, broken windows, rusted towers, rain beginning to fall<br>**Environment:** 3 AM, heavy storm clouds, distant lightning illuminating the structure, puddles forming on cracked concrete<br>**Note:** Atmospheric, ominous. Camera slowly pushes toward main entrance. | "For months, this abandoned power station has been Haunter's undisputed domain. Tonight, that changes." | ~8 sec |
| **02** | **Shot Type:** Interior tracking shot, low angle<br>**Subject:** Haunter floating through dark corridor, gaseous purple body glowing faintly, attempting to phase through a wall<br>**Environment:** Pitch-black hallway lit only by Haunter's bioluminescence, dust particles floating, air humid<br>**Note:** Haunter hits the wall and bounces back—cannot phase through. Shows confusion/alarm in body language. | "Haunter attempts to phase through the wall. Impossible. An intruder has stolen the ghost's power." | ~8 sec |
| **03** | **Shot Type:** Reveal shot, medium close-up<br>**Subject:** Magneton hovering in the main generator room, three magnetic units rotating slowly, electrical arcs jumping between magnets<br>**Environment:** Emergency lights flickering on powered by Magneton, casting harsh blue-white light, electromagnetic field visible as distortion in the air<br>**Note:** Magneton is stationary, humming mechanically. Not aggressive—just existing. | "The source: Magneton. Its powerful electromagnetic field has turned Haunter's refuge into a prison." | ~8 sec |
| **04** | **Shot Type:** Extreme close-up macro<br>**Subject:** Haunter's clawed hand trying to phase through a metal beam, but the hand becomes solid and clangs against steel<br>**Environment:** Sparks from Magneton's field visible in background, purple gaseous hand solidifying into black chitin<br>**Note:** Focus on texture transition—gas to solid. Haunter recoils in pain/frustration. | "The electromagnetic field forces Haunter's gaseous body into solid flesh. The predator becomes vulnerable." | ~8 sec |
| **05** | **Shot Type:** Wide shot from Haunter's perspective<br>**Subject:** Rattata colony fleeing through a broken window, scattering in panic<br>**Environment:** Moonlight streaming through rain-soaked window, Rattata silhouettes escaping, empty food wrappers and nests left behind<br>**Note:** Show the emptiness—Haunter's prey base is abandoning the territory. | "The Rattata flee into the night, abandoning their nests. When territory fails, adaptation becomes survival." | ~8 sec |
| **06** | **Shot Type:** Medium tracking shot, following Haunter<br>**Subject:** Haunter floating down a flooded stairwell into the basement, water rising to the third step, purple reflection on black water surface<br>**Environment:** Emergency exit signs casting red glow, rain dripping through ceiling cracks, water rippling<br>**Note:** Haunter moves deliberately, calculating. This is reconnaissance. | "Haunter descends into the flooded basement. Conductive water pooled on concrete. A potential weapon awaits." | ~8 sec |
| **07** | **Shot Type:** Low angle, ground-level perspective from water<br>**Subject:** Haunter's reflection in the flooded basement water, performing its beckoning gesture—slow, hypnotic hand movements<br>**Environment:** Almost complete darkness except faint purple bioluminescence, water perfectly still creating mirror effect<br>**Note:** The beckoning dance from canonical lore. Eerie, ritualistic. | "Haunter performs the ancient beckoning dance. A hypnotic lure refined over millennia, older than memory." | ~8 sec |
| **08** | **Shot Type:** Intercutting between basement and upper floor<br>**Subject:** Magneton detecting energy signature below, beginning to descend the stairs toward the flooded basement<br>**Environment:** Magneton's magnetic field creating visible electrical distortion, emergency lights flickering more intensely as it moves<br>**Note:** Magneton is curious, not hostile. Moving slowly downward. | "Magneton detects the energy signature below. Curious, not hostile, the steel-type descends toward the trap." | ~8 sec |
| **09** | **Shot Type:** Wide shot from behind Haunter<br>**Subject:** Magneton hovering at the top of the flooded stairs, beginning to descend into the water, magnetic units rotating<br>**Environment:** Rain visible through broken ceiling, Magneton's reflection appearing in the rising water, Haunter floating motionless in far corner<br>**Note:** Tension building. Magneton enters the trap. | "Magneton hovers at the threshold. Its reflection appears in the rising water. Into the abyss." | ~8 sec |
| **10** | **Shot Type:** Extreme close-up macro<br>**Subject:** Haunter's gaseous body releasing purple toxic gas from its pores, the poison spreading across the water's surface like oil<br>**Environment:** Black water with purple gas creeping across surface in tendrils, bioluminescent veins glowing brighter in Haunter's body as it releases toxin<br>**Note:** Beautiful but deadly. The poison spreads slowly, organically. | "Haunter releases poison into the water. Harmless to steel. But in conductive liquid, chemistry becomes physics." | ~8 sec |
| **11** | **Shot Type:** Medium shot, Magneton's perspective<br>**Subject:** Magneton's lowest magnet unit touching the poisoned water, electrical arcs immediately jumping into the conductive liquid<br>**Environment:** Purple toxic water now glowing with electrical discharge, sparks flying, steam rising where electricity meets poison<br>**Note:** Violent reaction. Magneton begins sparking erratically. | "Magneton touches poisoned water. Electricity arcs through the liquid instantly. The field becomes its undoing." | ~8 sec |
| **12** | **Shot Type:** Close-up on Magneton<br>**Subject:** Magneton's magnetic units spinning wildly out of control, electrical arcs misfiring, the electromagnetic field collapsing<br>**Environment:** Emergency lights exploding from power surge, sparks showering down, toxic steam filling the stairwell<br>**Note:** Magneton is in distress—not defeated, but overwhelmed. System failure. | "Magnetic units spin wildly as systems fail and the electromagnetic field finally collapses into destruction." | ~8 sec |
| **13** | **Shot Type:** Tracking shot, following Magneton<br>**Subject:** Magneton fleeing upward through the stairwell, trailing sparks and smoke, magnetic units spinning irregularly<br>**Environment:** Dark stairwell with emergency red lighting, toxic purple mist rising from below, rain visible at the top exit<br>**Note:** Retreat, not death. Magneton is damaged but escapes. | "Magneton flees upward trailing smoke and sparks as damaged systems struggle but survival remains victory." | ~8 sec |
| **14** | **Shot Type:** Wide shot, high angle looking down into basement<br>**Subject:** Haunter floating in the center of the flooded, poisoned basement, bioluminescence pulsing victoriously, toxic water glowing purple around it<br>**Environment:** Basement now entirely Haunter's domain—dark, toxic, deadly. Emergency lights dead. Only purple glow remains.<br>**Note:** Haunter has reclaimed the lower territory. Dominance re-established. | "Haunter floats triumphant in poisoned depths where territory is reclaimed through cunning adaptation alone." | ~8 sec |
| **15** | **Shot Type:** Vertical split composite<br>**Subject:** Top half: Magneton hovering in the upper generator room, still sparking but stabilizing. Bottom half: Haunter floating in the flooded basement below.<br>**Environment:** Upper half shows harsh electrical light. Lower half shows purple toxic glow. Clear vertical division of territory within a single frame.<br>**Note:** Visual metaphor—stalemate. Coexistence through separation. Both domains visible simultaneously in one shot. | "Electrical light above and toxic darkness below where both now survive in territorial balance." | ~8 sec |
| **16** | **Shot Type:** Extreme wide shot, exterior drone pull-back<br>**Subject:** Power station exterior, upper windows flickering with blue electrical light, basement windows glowing faint purple<br>**Environment:** Storm clearing, first hints of dawn on horizon, rain stopping, puddles reflecting both lights<br>**Note:** Final establishing shot. Two territories in one building. Peaceful but tense equilibrium. | "Two domains within one structure where the balance of power now holds precariously in equilibrium." | ~8 sec |

## Director's Notes

**Key Thematic Elements:**
- This is not a story of good vs. evil, but territory and adaptation
- Neither creature is villainous—both are simply trying to survive
- The resolution is a stalemate, not a decisive victory (realistic ecology)

**Visual Priorities:**
1. **Texture Contrast:** Gaseous purple ghost vs. metallic chrome steel
2. **Light Sources:** Bioluminescence (purple) vs. Electromagnetic discharge (blue-white)
3. **Water as Character:** The flooded basement is the key to the entire story

**Sound Design Notes:**
- Magneton: Mechanical humming, electrical crackling, magnetic resonance
- Haunter: Rattling wheeze (canonical), water displacement, toxic gas hissing
- Environment: Rain, dripping water, electrical sparks, building settling

**Attenborough Narration Style:**
- Vocabulary level: Advanced (conductive, sentinel, amplifier)
- Sentence length: 5-12 words per sentence
- Tone: Observational, not judgmental
- Pace: Slow, deliberate, allowing visuals to breathe
