## Shot List

| Clip # | Seed Image | Motion Prompt | Duration | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | `env_power_station_exterior_night.png` | Rain begins to fall with droplets visible streaking downward. Lightning flashes illuminate the power station structure briefly. Puddles ripple on cracked concrete. Volumetric fog rolls between structures. Camera slowly pushes forward toward the building entrance. | ~7 sec | Establishing shot - atmospheric, ominous |
| **02** | `composites/clip_02_composite.png` | Haunter floats in dark corridor. Haunter presses both clawed hands against wall attempting to phase through. Haunter bounces backward unable to phase. Purple bioluminescent glow pulses brighter. Clawed hands pull back from wall. Dark purple smoke swirls around Haunter. Dust particles float in humid air. Slow zoom in. | ~6 sec | Introduces conflict - Haunter cannot phase through wall |
| **03** | `composites/clip_03_composite.png` | Magneton's three magnetic spheres rotate slowly and independently. Electrical arcs crackle and jump continuously between the units with bright blue-white discharge. Electromagnetic field creates visible heat-shimmer distortion rippling outward. Emergency lights flicker in background. Volumetric dust drifts through the space. Slow push in. | ~6 sec | Reveal of intruder - Magneton establishing presence |
| **04** | `composites/clip_04_composite.png` | Haunter's clawed hand reaches toward metal beam. Hand presses against beam surface attempting to phase through. Gaseous purple texture solidifies to dark solid texture as hand fails to phase. Hand pulls back from beam. Electromagnetic field sparks in background. Purple glow flickers. Slow zoom in. | ~5 sec | Macro detail - texture transition from gas to solid |
| **05** | `characters/rattata_fleeing_silhouette_core.png` | Multiple Rattata scatter across rain-soaked window in panicked flight. Bodies stretch mid-sprint with legs extended and long tails streaming. Some leap across frame while others scramble desperately. Water droplets stream down glass catching moonlight. Silhouettes move frantically away from interior darkness. Slow pan right. | ~7 sec | Consequence - prey abandoning territory |
| **06** | `composites/clip_06_composite.png` | Haunter floats deliberately downward through the stairwell descending toward flooded basement. Purple reflection appears in black water surface below. Rain drips through ceiling cracks creating ripples. Red emergency exit signs cast crimson glow. Haunter moves with calculated purpose. Slow tilt down. | ~6 sec | Reconnaissance - Haunter planning strategy |
| **07** | `composites/clip_07_composite.png` | Haunter floats above mirror-smooth water. Haunter performs slow hypnotic beckoning gesture. Both clawed hands extend forward in ritualistic motion with palms outward and fingers moving deliberately. Purple glow reflects perfectly in still water creating symmetrical doubled effect. Dark purple smoke swirls slowly. The reflection mirrors every movement exactly. Slow orbit. | ~6 sec | Ancient lure - ritualistic, eerie beckoning dance |
| **08** | `composites/clip_08_composite.png` | Magneton descends cautiously down the stairwell with three magnetic units tilted in descent formation. The spheres rotate slightly faster indicating heightened alertness. Electrical arcs brighten and increase in frequency. Electromagnetic field creates visible distortion in humid air. Red emergency lights flicker more intensely as Magneton passes. Slow tilt down. | ~5 sec | Curiosity - Magneton drawn downward to investigate |
| **09** | `composites/clip_09_composite.png` | Magneton hovers at top of flooded stairs. Magneton begins to descend into water. Magnetic units rotate steadily. Reflection appears in rising black water below. Rain streams through broken ceiling above creating atmospheric light shafts. Haunter barely visible floating motionless in far background corner. Slow zoom in. | ~5 sec | The trap is set - Magneton entering danger |
| **10** | `composites/clip_10_composite.png` | Haunter releases dense purple toxic gas from body surface. Poison streams outward from pores in organic tendrils and wisps. The toxic gas spreads deliberately across black water surface in methodical patterns with darker purple oily smoky appearance. Eyes glow bright purple intensely during release. Gas tendrils creep and spread slowly across water. Slow drift right. | ~7 sec | Weapon deployed - poison spreading across water |
| **11** | `composites/clip_11_composite.png` | Magneton's lowest magnetic sphere touches poisoned purple water surface. Electrical arcs jump into the conductive liquid creating blue-white discharge. Sparks fly upward. Steam rises where electricity meets water. Chrome surfaces reflect electrical patterns. Water surface ripples and glows. Slow zoom in. | ~5 sec | Chain reaction - conductivity effect |
| **12** | `composites/clip_12_composite.png` | Magneton's three magnetic spheres spin wildly misaligned at different speeds. Electrical arcs misfire erratically. Sparks shower downward. Chrome surfaces spark. Emergency lights flicker intensely. Steam and electrical particles fill air. Electromagnetic field unstable. Slow zoom out. | ~5 sec | System failure - field collapsing |
| **13** | `composites/clip_13_composite.png` | Magneton moves upward through dark stairwell trailing sparks and smoke. Magnetic units rotate irregularly. Chrome surfaces show scorch marks. Electrical arcs stutter weakly. Purple mist rises from below. Red emergency lighting casts highlights on Magneton. Slow tilt up. | ~5 sec | Retreat upward through stairwell |
| **14** | `composites/clip_14_composite.png` | Haunter floats triumphantly in center of poisoned basement. Purple eyes glow at maximum brightness pulsing rhythmically. Both clawed hands extend outward in territorial dominance gesture. Purple glow expands and contracts creating waves of violet light across toxic water surface. Dark purple smoke swirls around Haunter. Steam rises from glowing poisoned water below. Slow zoom out. | ~7 sec | Victory - territory reclaimed |
| **15** | `composites/clip_15_split.png` | Vertical split screen shows two domains. Upper half: Magneton hovers in generator room still sparking but stabilizing. Magnetic units rotate steadily. Harsh blue-white electrical light fills space. Lower half: Haunter floats in poisoned basement. Purple glow pulses rhythmically. Toxic water glows beneath Haunter. Both domains visible simultaneously. Slow drift up. | ~8 sec | Equilibrium - Both domains coexisting |
| **16** | `env_power_station_exterior_dawn.png` | Power station exterior at dawn. Upper windows flicker with blue electrical light from Magneton's domain. Basement windows glow faint purple from Haunter's toxic water. Storm clearing with rain stopping. Dawn light gradient appears on horizon transitioning sky from purple-blue to orange-red. Puddles on ground reflect both light sources creating dual colored reflections. Wide exterior pull-back. | ~8 sec | Final establishing - balance of power achieved |

## Technical Director Notes

### Motion Philosophy
All prompts follow the **"Breathing Photograph"** principle:
- Focus on **micro-movements** (rotation, pulsing, drifting) rather than character displacement
- Emphasis on **texture in motion** (smoke swirling, electrical arcs crackling, water rippling)
- Each 8-second clip sustains ONE primary action/movement throughout

### Asset Usage Summary
**Character Assets Used:**
- Haunter variations: 5 clips (floating alert x2, beckoning dance, gaseous release, victorious floating)
- Haunter props: 1 clip (clawed hand macro)
- Magneton variations: 5 clips (hovering standard x2, descending alert x2, electrical distress, retreat damaged)
- Rattata: 1 clip (fleeing silhouette)

**Environment Assets Used:**
- Power station exteriors: 2 clips (night, dawn)
- Hallways: 2 clips (pitch black, metal beam)
- Stairwells: 3 clips (emergency lit x2, flooded x2)
- Flooded basement: 4 clips (clean x2, poisoned x3)
- Generator room: 2 clips

### Continuity Elements
**Consistent Across All Clips:**
- Rain/moisture atmosphere (matches Global Atmosphere Block)
- 3 AM abandoned power station setting
- Emergency lighting (red exit signs, flickering lights)
- Volumetric effects (mist, steam, dust particles)

**Light Source Consistency:**
- Haunter scenes: Purple bioluminescent glow
- Magneton scenes: Blue-white electrical discharge
- Environments: Red emergency lighting, minimal ambient moonlight

### Kling 2.5 Pro Technical Compliance
✅ All prompts describe motion only, not static scene (scene is in composite images)
✅ Single seed image system - composite assets combine character + environment
✅ Motion sustainable for full 10 seconds (slow, deliberate movements)
✅ No rapid character displacement that would cause morphing
✅ Atmospheric elements (rain, fog, sparks) provide natural continuous motion
✅ Clips 01 and 16 use environment-only images (no character needed)
✅ Clip 05 uses character-only image (Rattata silhouettes already include backlit window effect)
✅ Clip 15 uses vertical split composite (both domains in single seed image)

## Production Workflow

**Next Steps:**
1. Upload composite seed images to Kling 2.5 Pro (one image per clip)
2. Input motion prompts exactly as written
3. Generate 10-second clips
4. Trim to match audio narration (7-9 seconds per clip targeting 8 seconds)
5. Proceed to audio generation with ElevenLabs (16-word narrations = 8 seconds)
6. Final assembly in editing software

**Expected Output:**
- 16 video clips @ 10 seconds each = 160 seconds raw footage
- Trimmed to ~90 seconds final runtime (per script timing)
