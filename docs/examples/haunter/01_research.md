# Haunter - Species Profile

## 1. The Lore & Legend (The Source Material)

### Core Mythology
Haunter is a predator of the night, dwelling in perpetual darkness. Pokédex entries describe it as a creature that lurks in shadows, emerging only to lick its victims with a gaseous tongue that drains their life force. This licking induces violent shivering that never stops, eventually leading to death. It is said to beckon travelers into the darkness with eerie gestures, hiding in walls and crevices until prey approaches. The creature despises light and will flee from illuminated areas, making it a true denizen of the void.

### Behavioral Quirks
- **Shadow Stalking**: Haunter phases through solid walls, waiting motionless for hours before striking
- **The Beckoning Dance**: It performs slow, hypnotic gestures with its disembodied claws to lure prey closer
- **Tongue Projection**: Its tongue extends far beyond what seems physically possible, reaching victims from impossible angles
- **Nocturnal Ambush**: Active only in complete darkness; retreats immediately when exposed to bright light
- **Territory Marking**: Leaves cold spots and produces strange noises to claim hunting grounds

### The "Why" - Biological Explanation
The "spirit-guiding" mythology stems from Haunter's bioluminescent nervous system, which glows faintly purple in complete darkness. Ancient humans witnessing these floating lights mistook them for wandering souls. The "endless shivering" is actually a neurotoxic venom delivered through the tongue that disrupts the victim's thermoregulation center, causing hypothermia. The "beckoning" behavior is a form of motion mimicry—it produces ultrasonic frequencies that trigger curiosity responses in mammalian brains, drawing prey closer against their better judgment.

## 2. Physiological Profile (The Visuals)

### Real-World Analogues
- **Body Structure**: Portuguese Man O' War jellyfish (gaseous, semi-corporeal floating body)
- **Locomotion**: Octopus (tentacle-like appendages, fluid movement)
- **Texture**: Volcanic smoke combined with bioluminescent deep-sea organisms
- **Coloration**: Deep purple anemone with the translucency of a moon jelly
- **Size Reference**: Roughly the mass of a large mastiff (5 feet tall), but appears to defy gravity

### Scale & Mass
Haunter appears to weigh almost nothing, floating effortlessly through air currents. However, when it solidifies parts of its body to manipulate objects, it reveals surprising density—individual claws can grip with the force of a vice. It moves completely silently, creating localized cold fronts as it displaces air. The only sound it makes is a low, rattling wheeze from its constantly grinning mouth.

### Texture Bank
1. **Gaseous Membrane**: Semi-translucent purple fog that shifts between liquid and vapor states
2. **Bioluminescent Veins**: Electric-purple neural pathways visible through the body's surface
3. **Chitinous Claws**: Obsidian-black keratin that clicks when contracted
4. **Porous Tongue**: Sponge-like tissue covered in microscopic hollow needles
5. **Shadow-Edged**: The boundary between Haunter's body and air appears to absorb light, creating a dark halo

## 3. Ecological Niche (The Setting)

### Habitat
Haunter thrives in abandoned human structures—collapsed mines, derelict mansions, forgotten subway tunnels. The ideal environment features:
- **Lighting**: Near-total darkness with occasional cracks of moonlight
- **Humidity**: 80%+ (moisture helps maintain its gaseous form)
- **Temperature**: 45-55°F (cold enough to preserve its neurotoxins)
- **Atmosphere**: Stagnant air filled with dust particles that scatter minimal light

Graveyards and old battlefields are preferred territories, not for supernatural reasons, but because soil disturbed by burials creates networks of underground cavities perfect for ambush hunting.

### Diet & Hunting
Haunter is a parasitic energy vampire. Its tongue contains hollow microfilaments that pierce skin and drain bioelectrical energy directly from the nervous system. The "life force" it steals is literally the electrical impulses that power muscles and neurons. After feeding, victims experience:
- Severe muscle fatigue (ATP depletion)
- Hypothermia (disrupted thermoregulation)
- Tremors (damaged motor neurons)

Primary prey includes Rattata, Zubat, and wandering humans. A single feeding can sustain Haunter for 3-4 days. Uneaten prey is left paralyzed but alive—a strategy that keeps the local food source mobile enough to reproduce but too weak to flee.

### Natural Rivals
- **Kadabra**: Psychic emissions disrupt Haunter's phase-shifting ability
- **Magneton**: Electromagnetic fields destabilize its gaseous form
- **Houndour Packs**: Fire-types that hunt in groups; their flames drive Haunter from hiding spots
- **Sableye**: Competes for the same dark, enclosed habitats

## 4. Biological Abilities (Move Translation)

### Attack Mechanism - Shadow Ball
Haunter condenses ambient darkness into a sphere of hyper-concentrated dark matter by vibrating its gaseous body at specific frequencies. This creates a gravitational lensing effect that bends light around the projectile. Upon impact, the sphere releases a burst of infrared radiation that flash-freezes tissue while simultaneously triggering fear responses in the amygdala through subsonic vibrations. The attack appears supernatural but is actually a weaponized physics phenomenon.

### Defense Mechanism - Levitate/Phase Shift
Haunter's body exists partially outside normal spacetime due to exotic matter in its cellular structure (similar to helium but with negative mass properties). When threatened, it increases the ratio of exotic matter, allowing physical objects to pass through harmlessly. This isn't teleportation—observers report feeling sudden cold and seeing brief afterimages as Haunter "slides" between dimensions. The process is exhausting; prolonged phase-shifting causes parts of its body to dissipate permanently.

### Secondary Ability - Hypnosis
Haunter's eyes contain specialized photophores that pulse at 8-12 Hz—the exact frequency of human theta brain waves associated with drowsiness. Combined with trace amounts of airborne sedatives in its breath (gaseous derivatives of its poison sacs), victims experience microsleep episodes within 30 seconds of sustained eye contact.

## 5. The Evolutionary Arc (The Metamorphosis)

### The Trigger (Gastly → Haunter)
Gastly evolves when its gaseous body accumulates sufficient mass through feeding. The critical threshold occurs around 15-18 months of age when the creature's poison concentration reaches toxicity levels that would kill itself. To survive, it must undergo cellular differentiation.

### The Process
The transformation takes approximately 72 hours:
- **Hour 0-24**: Gastly compresses its entire body into a dense sphere, appearing to "suffocate" itself
- **Hour 24-48**: Internal temperature drops to near freezing as exotic matter crystallizes into proto-limbs
- **Hour 48-72**: The sphere violently expands, splitting into distinct segments (head, claws, detached body parts)

Witnesses describe it as watching smoke suddenly "remember" it used to be solid. The newly formed Haunter appears disoriented, frantically testing its new appendages by clawing at walls and surfaces.

### The Aftermath
Haunter gains tactical intelligence that Gastly lacks. Where Gastly simply enveloped prey, Haunter hunts strategically—it plans ambushes, creates distractions, and understands pack behavior well enough to divide groups. However, it also becomes more aggressive and territorial. Multiple Haunter cannot coexist in the same hunting ground; encounters between rivals escalate to fatal energy-draining duels.

### The Future (Haunter → Gengar)
Evolution to Gengar requires exposure to specific electromagnetic frequencies during a trade/bonding ritual. The bond creates a resonance that stabilizes Haunter's phase-shifting ability, allowing it to anchor partially to the physical world permanently. This dramatically increases its hunting effectiveness but sacrifices its ability to fully dematerialize.

## 6. "Natural Geographic" Story Hooks (Derived from Lore)

### Hook 1: The Whispering Mansion (Based on "It hides in walls and beckons people")
**Setup**: A film crew investigates reports of disappearances in the Lavender Town Tower ruins. Locals claim they've seen "purple lights beckoning from windows."

**The Reality**: A mature Haunter has claimed the entire third floor as territory. Over three months, it has lured 12 Rattata and 2 human explorers into a central chamber by creating rhythmic knocking sounds that trigger mammalian pattern-recognition instincts. Victims follow the sound deeper into the structure, where Haunter waits in a pitch-black room, tongue already extended.

**Climax**: The documentary team uses infrared cameras, accidentally revealing Haunter's thermal signature. Enraged by the "light," it attacks—but the cameras capture the first-ever footage of its hunting sequence in real-time.

### Hook 2: The Cold Front War (The Struggle)
**Setup**: A pack of Houndour has moved into Haunter's cave system, using the space as a winter den.

**The Conflict**: Haunter cannot phase-shift through the superheated air created by the Houndour's flames. Each time it tries to hunt, the temperature spike forces it to retreat. Meanwhile, the Houndour pups are disappearing one by one—taken during brief moments when the adults leave to hunt.

**Resolution**: The alpha Houndour sets a trap, using a pup as bait while the pack hides in ambush. When Haunter emerges to feed, they unleash coordinated Flamethrower attacks, filling the cave with light and heat. Haunter is forced to abandon its decade-long territory, drifting into the night to find new hunting grounds.

### Hook 3: The Emergence (The Life Cycle - Evolution)
**Setup**: A researcher has been tracking a juvenile Gastly for 16 months, documenting its feeding patterns.

**The Event**: One November night, the Gastly stops hunting entirely. It retreats to an abandoned well and compresses into a sphere no larger than a basketball. Temperature sensors show its core dropping to 23°F—impossible for any known organism.

**The Documentation**: Over three days, time-lapse cameras capture the metamorphosis. The sphere begins pulsing, expelling clouds of purple gas. Suddenly, two clawed hands tear through the membrane from inside. A head emerges, grinning impossibly wide. The creature—now Haunter—looks directly at the camera, as if aware it was being watched all along.

**The Implication**: It immediately phases through the well's stone walls and vanishes. Three days later, nearby shepherds report livestock found paralyzed with mysterious puncture wounds. The hunt has evolved.
