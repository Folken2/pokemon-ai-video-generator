# Sound Effects Prompts - The Light Invasion

**Pokemon:** Haunter
**Episode:** The Light Invasion
**Total Clips:** 16
**Duration per Clip:** 10 seconds

---

## Sound Design Overview

**General Environment:** Abandoned power station, night time (3 AM), heavy storm with continuous rain and thunder
**Continuous Ambient Bed:** Heavy rain, water dripping, wind whistling, building creaking, occasional thunder
**Additional Elements:** Electrical humming/crackling (Magneton scenes), water splashing (basement scenes), toxic gas hissing (poison scenes)
**Character Sounds:** Haunter (gaseous movement, rattling wheeze), Magneton (mechanical humming, magnetic resonance)
**Mood Progression:** Ominous tension → Strategic planning → Trap execution → Violent confrontation → Victorious aftermath → Tense stalemate

## Sound Effects Prompt Table

| Clip # | Scene Summary | Sound Effect Prompt | Duration |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **01** | Establishing shot - power station exterior, storm approaching | Continuous abandoned power station exterior ambience with heavy rain beginning to fall on metal structures and concrete, distant thunder rumbling steadily, wind howling through broken towers and rusted beams, water forming puddles on cracked pavement, with ominous stormy atmosphere throughout, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **02** | Haunter floating through dark corridor, attempts to phase through wall | Continuous dark hallway ambience with heavy rain pattering outside, steady water dripping echoing through empty corridor, wind whistling through cracks, building creaking and settling, with faint ghostly movement sounds and occasional wall impact, eerie abandoned atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **03** | Reveal shot - Magneton hovering in generator room, electromagnetic field active | Continuous generator room ambience with mechanical humming and magnetic resonance, electrical arcs crackling continuously, emergency lights flickering and buzzing, rain audible through walls, wind causing building to creak, with electromagnetic field creating subtle air distortion sounds, tense industrial atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **04** | Extreme close-up - Haunter's hand solidifying against metal beam | Continuous electromagnetic interference ambience with electrical sparks crackling, rain drumming on metal surfaces, wind whistling outside, building settling sounds, with gaseous transformation sounds and metallic clanging as hand hits steel beam, frustrated wheeze layered in, tense uncomfortable atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **05** | Wide shot - Rattata colony fleeing through broken window | Continuous storm ambience with heavy rain falling, wind gusting strongly through broken window, building creaking under storm pressure, water dripping from ceiling, with rapid scurrying and squeaking sounds, tiny claws scratching on surfaces, glass crunching, panicked evacuation atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **06** | Haunter descending flooded stairwell into basement | Continuous flooded stairwell ambience with rain dripping through ceiling cracks steadily, water echoing in stairwell shaft, wind howling through upper floors, building creaking and settling, with gaseous whooshing of Haunter descending, water lapping at steps, deliberate calculated movement atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **07** | Low angle - Haunter performing beckoning dance reflected in water | Continuous basement water ambience with rain distantly pattering above, slow steady water dripping creating ripples, wind faintly audible from upper floors, building settling quietly, with hypnotic swishing of beckoning hand movements, subtle purple bioluminescence humming, ancient ceremonial atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **08** | Magneton detecting energy signature, beginning to descend stairs | Continuous power station ambience with rain falling heavily, wind whistling through structure, water dripping in multiple locations, building creaking, with mechanical humming intensifying as Magneton moves, magnetic units rotating and clicking, electromagnetic distortion sounds, curious cautious atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **09** | Magneton hovering at flooded stairs threshold, descending into water | Continuous basement threshold ambience with rain dripping through broken ceiling heavily, wind gusting through gaps, water rippling from electromagnetic interference, building settling under storm, with Magneton's magnetic field humming louder, metal units rotating steadily, trap springing tension atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **10** | Extreme close-up - Haunter releasing poison gas into water | Continuous flooded basement ambience with rain dripping steadily, wind whistling distantly, water gently lapping, building creaking quietly, with toxic purple gas hissing from Haunter's pores, poison spreading with oily slithering sounds, bioluminescent veins pulsing organically, deadly chemical release atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **11** | Magneton's magnet touching poisoned water, electrical arcs jumping | Continuous storm and water ambience with rain drumming, wind howling, water churning from electromagnetic reaction, building vibrating, with violent electrical discharge crackling loudly, sparks flying and sizzling, steam hissing where electricity meets poison, dangerous chemical reaction atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **12** | Close-up - Magneton's units spinning wildly out of control | Continuous chaotic ambience with rain pounding, wind screaming through structure, toxic steam hissing continuously, building groaning under stress, with magnetic units spinning and grinding wildly, electrical arcs misfiring erratically, emergency lights exploding, electromagnetic field collapsing with deep hum, system failure atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **13** | Magneton fleeing upward through stairwell, damaged | Continuous stairwell ambience with rain echoing, wind rushing through shaft, toxic mist rising with wet sizzling, building settling after chaos, with rapid mechanical ascending sounds, stuttering damaged motors, sparks trailing continuously, smoke hissing from components, desperate escape atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **14** | Wide angle - Haunter triumphant in flooded poisoned basement | Continuous poisoned basement ambience with rain dripping into toxic water, wind whistling through upper structure, contaminated water bubbling quietly with purple glow, building settling after battle, with victory pulsing from Haunter's body as low hum, poisonous atmosphere fully established, triumphant atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **15** | Split screen - Magneton above stabilizing, Haunter below in toxic glow | Continuous two-level ambience with upper floor harsh electrical humming and crackling from stabilizing Magneton, rain audible on both levels, wind whistling through entire building, lower floor toxic water bubbling quietly, both spaces settling into uneasy coexistence, tense stalemate atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |
| **16** | Exterior pull-back - power station with two distinct light sources | Continuous exterior ambience with storm clearing and rain slowing to drizzle, wind diminishing but still present, water dripping from structures, building creaking and settling after storm, with electrical buzzing from upper windows, faint toxic bubbling from basement level, peaceful equilibrium atmosphere, subtle nature documentary sound effect | 10s |

## Notes

- Each 10-second sound effect emphasizes **continuous ambient sounds first** (rain, wind, dripping, creaking, humming)
- Action sounds are **layered on top** of the ambient bed, not replacing it
- **NO SILENCE** - every clip has environmental sounds filling all 10 seconds
- Sound effects work as background layer (mixed below narrator voice at ~25% volume)
- Storm continuity maintained across all clips (rain present in every scene)
- All sounds are realistic nature documentary style, no music or fantasy elements
